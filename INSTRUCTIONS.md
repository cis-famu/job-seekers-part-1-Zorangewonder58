## Submission Instructions

Once you've completed the required user stories for your project, take the following steps to get your project ready to submit.

1. Push Code to Github Repository
    - If this week's assignment is starting a new project. However, if the week's assignment is a continuation of the last week's project, you will NOT create a new project. Copy the project files into the new repository folder and make an initial commit.

2. Create a README Template
    - Every submission must be accompanied by a README.md using the readme template provided with the assignment to demonstrate which required and optional tasks you've completed.
    - In your project repository, add a README.md file in the root directory that contains the contents similar to the [README template](https://hackmd.io/@vacoote89/H17PTNecT/edit).
    - If the assignment is a continuation of the same project from a previous week, add the new template to the end of the previous README instead of creating a new file.
    - Make sure to check off the user stories you've completed.

3. GIF Walkthrough
    - Your README.md must contain a GIF walkthrough using a recording program of your choice. It should demonstrate how it works with the user stories completed.
    - I recommend [Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS, [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows, and [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux.
    - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) is a great service for hosting the GIF walkthrough and then linking to it from
      the README.
    - When using Imgur, you can right-click on the gif and choose "Copy Image Address" to get the correct address. Make sure the address has a `.gif` extension. If you end up with a url that has a `.gifv` extension, removing the `v` and changing this to `.gif` will ensure the gif renders on GitHub.

4. Make sure you've pushed all your latest code up to GitHub
    - To check this, you can browse your repository on GitHub on your favorite browser to make sure some of your latest changes are present there.

Here is a link to the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to update your README file.
